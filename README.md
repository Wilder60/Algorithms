# Algorithms
An implementation of a variety algorithms in multiple languages.
Hopefully it will be expanded upon whenever I have time.

# Algorithms implementated:
## Sorts:
- Insertion Sort (C#, Go)
- Selection Sort (C#, Go)
- Bubble Sort (C#, Go)
- Quick Sort (C#, Go)
## Dynamic Programming:
- Fibonacci Numbers (Go)
- Needleman-Wunsh Global Aligment (Go)
